## Day 36

### Containerizing a MERN Stack Application and Deploying using Docker Compose  

Two-Tier Architecture
Two-tier architecture means your application is divided into two main layers:

Client Layer (Frontend)

Server Layer (Backend / Database)

These two layers communicate directly with each other.

Three-Tier Architecture
Three-tier architecture adds an extra middle layer (application logic layer) between the client and database.
It has three layers:

Presentation Layer (Frontend/UI)

Application Layer (Business Logic)

Database Layer (Data Storage)
