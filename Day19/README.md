## Ansible

### What is Ansible?

Ansible is an **IT automation tool** maintained by **Red Hat**.
It is built using **Python** and is widely used for automating IT tasks like configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.

---

### Why Do We Need to Automate?

 Without automation:
If we want to download and install software on multiple servers, we need to **manually log in to each server (via SSH)** and install one by one.

* This is **time-consuming**.
* High chances of **human error**.

 With Ansible:

* We install Ansible only on **one control server**.
* Write configurations in **Inventory files** and **Playbooks**.
* Ansible then **pushes tasks** to all other servers automatically.

### Example Playbook (YAML File)

```yaml
---
- name: Install and Start nginx
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  become_user: root

  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

 This playbook will:

1. Install **nginx** on all servers.
2. Start the **nginx service**.
