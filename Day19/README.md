Ansible 

What is Ansible?
--> Ansible is an IT Automation tool which is maintain by redhat it is made by python.

Why do we need to Automate?
--> If we want to download & install any software into machine we have to manually login to each server (SSH) and downaload & install one by one. This approach was time consuming and chances of making error.
    Ansible make this task in efficent way.
