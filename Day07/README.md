Shell Scripting 01

What is the purpose of scripting and automation?
--> Scripting and automation are fundamentals in IT, DevOps, Software Devlopment and system adminstration. Their purpose is to save time, reduce errors, and improve efficency by automating manual or repetitve task.

Example of Use Cases

Task                                      Scripted Automation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Server setup                          install software, configure service, open firewall ports.
2. Deployment                            Build code, run test to staging/production.
3. Monitoring                            Health checks for services, disk space alerts.


What is the purpose of #!/bin/bash or #!bin/sh?
--> The line is called "Shebang", and it tells the system which interpreter to use when executing a script.

:q, :wq!

-! --> puts you into command mode.
-w --> stands for write(save).
-q --> stands for quit (exit the editor).
-! --> means force.

--> Doesn't need permission to run.

./
