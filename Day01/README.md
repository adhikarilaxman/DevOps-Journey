# DevOps Basics – My Learning Journey

This repository contains my notes and understanding of **DevOps concepts**.

## 1. What is DevOps?

DevOps is a **process of improving ** the application delivery by ensuring:

* Automation
* Quality
* Continuous Monitoring & Observability
* Continuous Testing

---

## 2. Why DevOps?

About 10+ years ago, there were no DevOps engineers. The entire application delivery process was **manual** and handled by:

* System Administrators
* Build & Release Engineers
* Server Administrators

Problems with the old approach:

* Time-consuming release cycles
* High chances of errors
* No automation

DevOps solves these issues by **automating processes**, ensuring faster, more reliable, and scalable delivery.
