## Configuration Management with Ansible

### Tools for Configuration Management

1. Puppet
2. Chef
3. Ansible
4. Salt

---

### ðŸ”¹ What is Configuration Management?

Configuration Management is the process of **automating the setup, management, and maintenance of servers and applications**.

Instead of manually installing software or changing setups on each server, tools like **Ansible** handle it for you.

---

### Why Ansible?

* **Agentless** â†’ No need to install extra software on target servers.
* **Simple** â†’ Uses YAML (easy, human-readable language).
* **Automation** â†’ Handles repetitive tasks (installing software, configuring servers, deploying apps).
* **Scalable** â†’ Works with a few servers or thousands at once.

### ðŸ”¹ Difference Between Puppet and Ansible

| **Puppet**                | **Ansible**         | **Explanation**                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pull Model**            | **Push Model**      | Puppet uses a **pull model** (agents pull from Master). Ansible uses a **push model** (control node pushes configs). |
| **Master/Slave**          | **Agentless**       | Puppet needs a **Master + Agents**. Ansible only needs **SSH/WinRM** (no agents).                                    |
| **DSL (Puppet Language)** | **YAML (Simple)**   | Puppet uses a special language (DSL). Ansible uses simple **YAML**.                                                  |
| **Linux-focused**         | **Linux & Windows** | Puppet was built mainly for Linux (Windows added later). Ansible supports both well.                                 |

### ðŸ”¹ Disadvantages of Ansible

1. **Windows Support (Limited)** â†’ Strong on Linux, but fewer features for Windows.
2. **Debugging Issues** â†’ Error messages/logs are not always clear.
3. **Performance (Speed)** â†’ Can be slower on very large infrastructures since it pushes configs to each server.

---

### Questions Asked

1. **Which language does Ansible use?**
   â†’ Python (backend), YAML (for playbooks).

2. **Which OS supports Ansible?**
   â†’ Works on both **Linux** (via SSH) and **Windows** (via WinRM).

3. **Which mechanism does Ansible use?**
   â†’ **Push Mechanism**.

4. **Does Ansible support all cloud platforms?**
   â†’ Yes  (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
