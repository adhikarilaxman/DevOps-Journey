Git And GitHub

What is Version Control System?
--> A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps developers track, manage, and control changes to code or files over time.

Version Control
|
|--> CVS | --> Centralized
|--> SVN | --> Centralized
|--> GIT | --> Distributed
|

Centralized VCS
--> In Centralized VCS, there is one central server that stores the project history.

Developers connect to this server to get the latest version of code.

If the server goes down, nobody can collaborate until it’s back.

Examples: SVN (Subversion), CVS

 Distributed VCS
--> In Distributed VCS, every developer has a complete copy of the entire project history on their own computer.

Developers can work offline and later sync with others.

Even if the main server goes down, anyone’s copy can restore the project.

Examples: Git, Mercurial

What is Fork in GitHub?
--> A fork is a personal copy of someone else’s repository.
When you fork a repo on GitHub:

It creates a copy under your account.

You can freely make changes in your fork without affecting the original project.

Later, if you want, you can send your changes back to the original repo via a Pull Request (PR).

Some Git Command -
1. git status
2. git add .
3. git log
4. git commit -m "Initial Commit"
5.  git reset --hard  (To go to the previous version)
