### Project Management Tools for DevOps

**What is Agile?**


--> Agile is a way of working on projects step by step instead of doing everything at once.

* Work is divided into small parts called **sprints** (usually 1–4 weeks).
* After each sprint, you get a working product or feature.
* Teams can change plans quickly if needed.

**Simple Example:**
Instead of building a whole app in 6 months, you build small features every 2 weeks and improve them based on feedback.

**What is Scrum?**


--> Scrum is a way of working within Agile. It gives a **framework** to manage and organize tasks in small, repeatable cycles called **sprints**.

**Key Points:**

* **Sprints:** Short time periods (usually 1–4 weeks) where the team completes a set of tasks.

**Roles:**

* **Product Owner:** Decides what needs to be built (prioritizes tasks).
* **Scrum Master:** Makes sure the team follows Scrum rules and removes obstacles.
* **Development Team:** Builds the product (developers, testers, etc.).

**Meetings / Ceremonies:**

* **Sprint Planning:** Decide which tasks to do in the sprint.
* **Daily Standup:** Short daily meeting to update progress.
* **Sprint Review:** Show what was done at the end of the sprint.
* **Sprint Retrospective:** Discuss what went well and what can be improved.

**Backlog:**
A list of all tasks/features to be done, maintained by the Product Owner.

**Project Management Tool – Jira**


--> Jira is a project management tool widely used for Agile projects.

**What it does:**

* Keep a list of tasks (**backlog**).
* Plan tasks for each sprint.
* Track progress of tasks.
* Show reports on team performance.
