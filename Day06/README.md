## Day06 Notes

### Linux Operating System & Basics of Shell Scripting

**Operating System** → An operating system is the core computer program that acts as a bridge between software and hardware.

**Kernel**

* The kernel is the core component of an operating system.
* Its responsibility is to establish communication between hardware and software.

The four primary responsibilities are:

1. Device Management
2. Memory Management
3. Process Management
4. Handling System Calls

---

### Shell Scripting

* Shell scripting is a text file with a list of commands that instruct an operating system to perform certain tasks.

---

### Basic Linux Terminal Commands

1. `ls` → Display information about files in the current directory
2. `pwd` → Display the current directory
3. `mkdir` → Create a directory
4. `cd` → Navigate between different folders
5. `rm` → Delete files
6. `mv` → Rename or move files
7. `touch` → Create empty files
8. `cat` → Display file contents on the terminal

---

### Checking CPU, Memory, and Disk Size

1. `nproc` → Show number of CPUs
2. `df -h` → Show disk size (human-readable)
3. `top` → Monitor processes and resource usage
4. `free` → Check the amount of free and used memory
